Here’s the updated **Tech Stack** section with a new bullet for GitKraken:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project harnesses a range of modern tools and technologies:

1. **⚛️ React.js**  
   Driving the front end, React’s modular structure makes it easy to build and maintain an interactive UI.

2. **🎨 Figma**  
   I redesigned my resume in Figma (originally made in Canva). I exported it as an SVG to feed into Spline for 3D rendering and hero section animations.

3. **💫 Spline**  
   Powers interactive 3D elements. I briefly used the premium version to remove watermarks and unlock extra features.

4. **🔥 Firebase**  
   Hosts the website and ensures things run smoothly for visitors. No more complicated servers—just quick deployment.

5. **⚙️ GitHub Actions**  
   Every time I push changes, GitHub Actions automatically updates the live site, so you’re always seeing the latest version.

6. **🌐 Namecheap**  
   Keeps the domain name—[loganfalkenberg.com](http://loganfalkenberg.com/)—up and running.

7. **💻 Uiverse.io**  
   Adds that extra bit of flair with open-source HTML/CSS components and dynamic UI elements.

8. **📧 Email.js**  
   Handles the contact form functionality, letting users shoot me an email directly from the site.

9. **🛠️ GitKraken**  
   For version control, I use GitKraken to push/pull the repo. It simplifies git interactions (compared to GitHub Desktop or CLI), especially for large projects like this. GitKraken handles challenges like **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) seamlessly, making it a highly recommended tool for managing version control efficiently.

        Hello! My name is Logan Falkenberg, a Senior at Texas State University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Graduating in May 2025, I have a strong passion for both front-end and back-end development. I strive to create applications that balance efficiency with user-friendly interfaces, focusing on intuitive design and maintainable code. My technical proficiency spans various programming languages and frameworks.

        As a motivated learner and problem-solver, I thrive in collaborative environments, seamlessly leading projects and working within teams to achieve success. My experience as a Lead Instructor at Code Ninjas has enhanced both my technical skills and my ability to mentor others. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to full-stack development roles, as they offer the opportunity to engage with every stage of software creation. I look forward to leveraging my skills to contribute to impactful and innovative projects in the tech industry.
